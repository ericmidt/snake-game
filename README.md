# snake-game
Snake game in Python using basic OOP concepts.

The user can control the snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The goal is to eat the food (orange circle), which relocates to a random location once eaten.

Also, everytime the user acomplishes this goal, the snake grows by one square and becomes a bit faster, making it harder to control.
